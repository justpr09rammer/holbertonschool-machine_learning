    Calculates the cost of a neural network with L2 regularization.

    Args:
        cost (float):The original cost of the network without regularization.
        lambtha (float): The regularization parameter (lambda).
        weights (dict): A dictionary of the weights of the neural network.

        float:
        The cost of the neural network including the L2 regularization term.
