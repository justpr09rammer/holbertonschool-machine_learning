    Performs forward propagation with dropout regularization for
    a neural network.

    Parameters:
    X (numpy.ndarray): Input data, shape (features, examples).
    weights (dict):
    A dictionary containing the weights and biases of the network.
            - W1, W2, ..., WL are the weight matrices for each layer.
            - b1, b2, ..., bL are the bias vectors for each layer.
    L (int): The number of layers in the neural network.
    keep_prob (float): The probability of keeping a unit active during dropout.

    Returns:
    dict:
    A dictionary containing the activations (A) and dropout masks (D)
    at each layer:
          - A0, A1, ..., AL are the activations.
          - D1, D2, ..., DL are the dropout masks for each layer.
