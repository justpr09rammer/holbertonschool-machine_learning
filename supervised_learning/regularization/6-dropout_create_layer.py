    """
    Creates a dense layer with dropout regularization.

    Parameters:
    prev (tensor):
    The input tensor to the layer.
    n (int):
    The number of units (neurons) in the dense layer.
    activation (function):
    The activation function to apply (e.g., tf.nn.relu).
    keep_prob (float):
    The probability of keeping a unit active during dropout (between 0 and 1).
    training (bool):
    A flag indicating whether the model is being trained.
    Dropout is only applied during training.

    Returns:
    tensor:
    The output tensor after applying the dense layer and dropout
    (if training is True).
